# Node Generator [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yeoman/generator-node)

`generator-node` creates a base template to start a new Node.js module.

It is also easily composed into your own generators so you can only target your efforts at your generator's specific features.

Maintained by [Hemanth.HM](http://github.com/hemanth).


## Install

```
$ npm install @trails/generator-node
```


## Usage

```
$ yo node
```

*Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files.*

That'll generate a project with all the common tools setup. This includes:

- Filled `package.json` file
- [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) task runner
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) ES2015 transpiler
- [mocha](http://mochajs.org/) unit test
- [ESLInt](http://eslint.org/) linting and code style checking
- [Istanbul](https://gotwarlost.github.io/istanbul/) code coverage (optionally tracked on [Coveralls](https://coveralls.io/))
- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) continuous integration (optional)
- [License](https://spdx.org/licenses/)

### Running tests

Once the project is scaffolded, inside the project folder run:

```
$ npm test
```

You can also directly use mocha to run test on single files:

```
$ npm -g install mocha
$ mocha test/name.js
```

### Publishing your code

Once your tests are passing (ideally with a Travis CI green run), you might be ready to publish your code to npm. We recommend you using [npm version](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version) to tag release correctly.

```
$ npm version major
$ git push --follow-tags
# ATTENTION: There is no turning back here.
$ npm publish
```

## Extend this generator

First of all, make sure you're comfortable with [Yeoman composability](http://yeoman.io/authoring/composability.html) feature. Then in your own generator:

```js
module.exports = generators.Base.extend({
  default: function () {
    this.composeWith('node:app', {
      options: {/* provide the options you want */}
    }, {
      local: require.resolve('generator-node/generators/app')
    });
  }
});
```

### Options

Here's a list of our supported options:

- `boilerplate` (Boolean, default true) include or not the boilerplate files (`lib/index.js`, `test/index.js`).
- `babel` (Boolean, default true) include or not a `.babelrc` file.
- `cli` (Boolean, default false) include or not a `lib/cli.js` file.
- `editorconfig` (Boolean, default true) include or not a `.editorconfig` file.
- `git` (Boolean, default true) include or not the git files (`.gitattributes`, `.gitignore`).
- `gulp` (Boolean, default true) include or not a `gulpfile`.
- `license` (Boolean, default true) include or not a `LICENSE` file.
- `travis` (Boolean, default true) include or not a `.travis.yml` file.
- `readme` (String) content of the `README.md` file. Given this option, generator-node will still generate the title (with badges) and the license section.

### Sub generators

If you don't need all the features provided by the main generator, you can still use a limited set of features by composing with our sub generators directly.

Remember you can see the options of each sub generators by running `yo node:sub --help`.

- `node:boilerplate`
- `node:babel`
- `node:cli`
- `node:editorconfig`
- `node:eslint`
- `node:git`
- `node:gulp`
- `node:license`
- `node:readme`
